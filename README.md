# Build a backend using Django (Python framework)

This project will teach you how to quickly build a backend for your web app using Django which is one of the most popular frameworks for backend development. Follow the steps and test it afterwards to see that it works properly. 

When you finish, you can use this project to customize it for your needs by creating your models, views (logic you want to apply on the backend with the info from your frontend), and API endpoints to communicate with your frontend.
